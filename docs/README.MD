# Rust-md

Rust-md is a fast markdown editor written in Rust. This project is heavily inspired by [hecto](https://github.com/dzodkin33/hecto-tutorial) and uses some of the solutions from there. This is a personal project of mine so if you have any suggestions on how I can improve the app don't hesitate to contact me.
